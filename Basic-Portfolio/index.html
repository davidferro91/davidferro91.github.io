                        I am currently a high school math teacher.  My Bachelor of Arts degree is from Case Western Reserve University with a double major in mathematics and education.  I have taught basically every high school math class that you can think of over my seven years of teaching, but Calculus and Trigonometry were always my favorites.  The problem solving aspects in those courses were always what intrigued me, which is also why I have branched out into full stack web development.  The creative yet still highly logical aspects of coding are quite exciting.  Finding solutions is a lot of fun, especially when they have positive impacts on others' lives.

                        Much of my creative exploits happen with music by singing in a choir, playing random instruments from time to time, and even dabbling a little bit in music composition.  My experience with designing and teaching lessons for students has also helped to flex my creative muscles, especially by searching for new ways that I can connect with others through my speaking and my daily visual presentations.  My love of logic is what drew me to mathematics, but it is extremely beneficial with my coding.  Part of my undergraduate career was learning javaScript as part of my math major.  I furthered that study by enrolling in the Case Western Reserve Full Stack Flex Bootcamp while still teaching full-time.

                        I am excited about the new skills that I have learned and cannot wait to use them in order to help others.  Whether it is using my teaching skills to break down complicated aspects of a website to explain to clients or peers or using my logical and creative skills to develop new sites and databases, the work that I do will always have the goal of making the world a little easier to understand, making it a little easier to interact, and bringing people a little closer together.
